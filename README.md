A Sonic hack dedicated someone I used to look up to (Clownancy), about the state of pop culture in the 2000s.

I released this back in 2019 on SSRG, but unfortunately, the community didn't take it seriously, and Clownancy was weirded out by it. I don't know why, but maybe it's because they can't comprehend my art. I'm sorry that it wasn't as good as it could have been, but I tried my best.

Perhaps this source code can help you understand it better...

As for what has happened with me, [well...](https://youtu.be/C1TEo9UU43g)
